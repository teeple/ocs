HOW TO INSTALL ORACLE SUPPORT IN DRUPAL 7

EXTRACT FILES

  cd <path to drupal dir>/includes/database/
  tar xzvf <oracle-7.x-*.tar.gz>
  cd oracle/module
  mv oracle <path to drupal dir>/sites/all/modules

CREATE A SCHEMA

  Create a user with appropriate defauls and temporary tablespaces:

    sqlplus / as sysdba

    grant connect,resource to drupal identified by drupal;
    alter user drupal default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp;
    grant execute on dbms_crypto to drupal;

    -- Optionally to use performance views:
    grant select on v_$sql_plan to drupal;
    grant select on v_$sqlarea to drupal;

  Or if you want to use table prefixes (read for details http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/sites--default--default.settings.php/7/source):

    grant dba, create any trigger, drop any table, select any table,
      select any sequence, create user to drupal identified by drupal;
    grant connect, resource to drupal with admin option;
    alter user drupal default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp;

  (TODO: those privilege are actually relaxed and should be better
   defined in the future, in general they are not needed for existing tables,
   but if you use modules like "Testing" you need to grant the drupal user rights 
   to create users because this kind of modules creates tables prefixes on the fly)

INSTALL DRUPAL

  Run http://<host>:<port>/drupal/install.php

  Refer to Drupal installation instructions for general information.

  For Oracle Database, typically the "Database name" will be the
  Oracle service name and the "Database Host" (A required field shown
  in the "Advanced" section) will the database's host server name.
  For example to use Oracle Database XE which is running on the same
  machine as Drupal, set "Database name" to "XE" and "Database host"
  to "localhost".

  Thanks to siromega it is possible to use a tnsnames.ora alias or any
  TNS valid string by specifying USETNS as the "Database host" at
  installation time and using the TNS string in the "Database name"
  field.  This may be particularly useful if you need to connect to an
  Oracle RAC instance.


POST INSTALLATION

  Once your site is installed go to
    http://<host>:<port>/drupal/admin/modules
  and enable the Oracle module.

  Then go to
    http://<host>:<port>/admin/config/development/oracle/blob
  and click "Schedule"

  Finally create linguistic indexes in your desired tablespace.  If no
  tablespace name is passed, the indexes are created in the USERS
  tablespace.

    sqlplus drupal/drupal
    exec create_linguistic_indexes('MYINDEXTABLESPACENAME')
